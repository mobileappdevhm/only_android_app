# Android CiE app

More and more MUAS students wanting to do an exchange year and visiting the University of Applied Science Munich, also called Hochschule MÃ¼nchen. Therefore our University has many courses in englisch, those are called Courses in English. Before now the process to submit for any courses were time consuming and complicated. To help the MUAS students we have created an app which should be simple and easy to use.
